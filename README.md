**Note**: On your Google Chrome on Android, to get the correct fullscreen provided by the app, you have to view the page as a "Desktop site". Not sure how it works on other browsers, it might be the same.

This game is my [Devtober 2020](https://itch.io/jam/devtober-2020) entry - a chilled game jam where the rule is to consistently work on your project.

## Assets

All images are created by me. They're just coloured shapes... you can use them if you ever need rectangles or circles. I got the other assets from these places:

Fonts: [Gugi](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gugi)
